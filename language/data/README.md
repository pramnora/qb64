# QBASIC/QB64 Data types

There are, basically, 3 different data types:   

Simple data type...  
- string(stores a 'single' data item: "text")  
- number(stores a 'single' number/or, value of an expression sum: 5/5*5)   

Complex data type...arrays...  
- a complex data type can store 'multiple' data items, at once;  
  normally, it stores one of the two simple types, either: string(s)/number(s)  

The simple data types, also, includes...       
-  Strings/(string functions)    
-  Numbers/(numerical functions/constants)  

Different number types include...        
-- integer    
-- float  
-- single    
-- double  
-- long    

-  Complex data types: arrays/recs/-etc.;  
   which can be made up of the aforementioned data types;  
   however, arrays are of a 'single' data type(string/integer/float/-etc.)      
   and, recs can be made up of 'mixed' data types;  
-  there is also user defined data types (which is also of 'mixed' data type)
