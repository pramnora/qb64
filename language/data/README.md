# QBASIC/QB64 Data types

There are, basically, 3 different data types:   

Simple data type...  

- string(stores a 'single' data item: "text")  
- number(stores a 'single' number/or, value of an expression sum: 5/5*5)   

Complex data type...arrays...  

- a complex data type can store 'multiple' usually related data items, at once;    
  normally, it stores one of the two simple types, either:   

-- string(s): "Jan","Feb","Mar"/-etc.  
-- number(s): 5,10,15,20,25,-etc.    

The simple data types, also, includes...       

-  Strings/(plus, string functions)    
-  Numbers/(plus, numerical functions/constants)  

Different number types include...          

-- integer    
-- float  
-- single    
-- double  
-- long    

- Complex data types: arrays/recs/-etc.;  
  which can be made up of the aforementioned data types; however,... 
  
-- arrays are of a 'single' data type(string/integer/float/-etc.)      
-- recs can be made up of 'mixed' data types;  
  
-  there is also 'user defined' data types (which is also of 'mixed' data type)  

Also, data can be stored, either...

- internally (array structures/parallel arrays/DATA statements/RECS/-etc.)    
- externally (file: [.dat]/[.csv]/-etc.)  

A large part of being a programmer is knowing...  

- what kind of data structure is best suited to store the program data items     
- what is the best way to read and retrieve such data items   

...for example, the programmer will tend to think awful hard about this...;  
'before' even attempting to go write their program.
