# QBASIC/QB64 Data types

There are, basically, 3 different data types: 

Singular...  
- string(stores a 'single' data item)  
- number(stores a 'single' number/or, value of an expression sum)  
Multiple...  
- complex(can store 'multiple' data items, at once)  

Also,...   
-  Strings/(string functions)    
-  Numbers/(numerical functions/constants)  
Different number types include...      
-- integer    
-- float  
-- single    
-- double  
-- long    
-  Complex data types: arrays/recs/-etc.;  
   which can be made up of the aforementioned data types;  
   however, arrays are of a single data type(string/integer/float/-etc.)      
   and, recs can be made up of mixed data types;  
-  there is also user defined data types
