# PROGRAM: Hello, world!
## (15 x different 'source code' variations)

My purpose here is to use the beginners 'Hello, world!' program to make a clear point;     
which is there are **tons** of different ways of writing a program  that produces the exact same surface 'output';      
which, in this particular case happens to be:     

> Hello, world!  

So, it's nearly always interesting  to look at what the underlying 'source code' looks like...;    
as opposed to just looking at the programs mere 'surface' output, alone.
