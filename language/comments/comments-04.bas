'Another time to use 'source code' comments...
'is when you wish to leave a number of different options available
'for the user to select directly from the 'source'.

PRINT 1           '...prints a numeric literal
'PRINT 1+1        '...prints an expression sum total
'PRINT "1+1=";1+1 '...prints both preceeding text/together with expression sum total

'So, here I'm illustrating the use of the PRINT statement to print out numbers;
'and, I've given 3 different possible ways of doing this;
'however, I've also gone and commented out 2 of the code lines: 6/7;
'thus, leaving it for the learner to go and 'uncomment' those lines for themselves;
'in order to discover what are the 2 other options available.
