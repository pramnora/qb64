'*** Comments are used to help document your programs underlying 'source code';
'    so helping to explain what it all means/or, what a particular section is doing.    

'    If code has been well commented; then, even people who are non-programmers
'    can understand what the code does...simply, by reading the 'source code' comments
'    which are written using plain english.
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'... 'Source code' commentary lines begin with a single apostrophe: (').

'...there are 2 diffent ways of writing 'source code' code comments;
'   either the comment is placed at the start of the line/
'   or else, the comment is placed at the end of a line of code.

'...this is a comment where the apostrophe has been written at the very start of the line

PRINT "Hello" '...this is a comment where the apostrope is written at the end of a QBASIC/QB64 COMMAND line statement
'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.    ALL 'source code' comments can be quite safely 'deleted' if you wish; 
'    as they are not necessary for successful program execution;
'    in fact, the QBASIC/QB64 interpreter/or else, compiler,
'    will totally 'ignore' ALL 'source code' comment lines;
'    as the interpreter/compiler are only interested in interpreting what is QBASIC/QB64 COMMANDS, instead.
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'    As an exercise, if you were to delete ALL of the 'source code' comments inside of this file;
'    then, you would be left with just one single command line statement which says...

'PRINT "Hello"
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
