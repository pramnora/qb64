'...INTRODUCTION:

'   Comment lines start with a single apostrophe: (')/
'   these are also referred to as being called: 'source code' comments;
'   they help explain what the program does using: 'plain, and, straight forwards english'...;
'   these comments can be read and understood even by people who are 'non-programmers' themselves.

'   On the other hand, it is really quite 'safe' to delete ALL 'source code' comments...;
'   because they are NOT actually code to be *run/executed*;
'   but, instead, the comments will be totally and completely 'ignored' by the QBASIC/QB64 interpreter/or else, compiler.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'   One way that programmers might choose to include comments documenting their underlying 'source code' is as follows...

'*** PROGRAM: Name (eg. Maths/12 x Tables/or, Graphics: Draw A Circle;
'             as soon as somebody sees/reads the title; then, they have a clear idea about what this program does)
'    VERSION: Number (Does the program have a particular version number.
'             eg. Version 1/Version II/
'             or, Version 1/Version 2/
'             or, Version 1.0.0/Version 1.0.1/Version 1.1.2/-etc.)
'   LANGUAGE: (Which programming language was used to create the program with/
'              too, which version of the programming language did you use.
'              eg. QBASIC/QB64.
'              you might even include a link to where the programming language software can be downloaded;
'              especially, if that software is FREE...; then, other people finding your program 'source code'
'              will be able to download the software; and, also, be able to *run/execute* the program.)
'   COMPUTER: (Was it a home based computer/school/or, work based/
'              too, what was the compuer OS/Operating System....created on either a PC/Mac/Linux/-etc.
'              eg. Home based PC/OS: Windows 10 Professional)
'     EDITOR: (Did you use a particular editor software/or, maybe, even, multiple editors.
'              eg. Windows Notepad/or, QB64 IDE/Integrated Development Environment)                
'    CREATED: (Date the program was first created.
'              Eg. 2020/or, May 2020/or, 10th May 2020/or, Sat 10th May 2020/-etc.
'              you might even choose to include the date/time/timezone: Sat 10TH May 2020 18:04 PM GMT)
'    UPDATED: (Date the program was last updated; this shows if you did 'update' the program/or, not; and, if so, when.
'              the details follows the same format as CREATED)
'    AUTHOR:  (Who created the program: Your name; or, maybe, your company name/-etc.)
'   LOCATION: (Where in the world the author is located...
'              NOTE: You don't need to include your exact address/
'              but, instead, just  give general details of where you live: Country, City: 
'              eg. UK, London;
'              in this way, the readers of the source code will know if you are living far away/or, near.)-
'    EMAIL: (What is the persons email...so that people can get in touch with you if necessary...
'            possibly to make requests to 'change/update' the program;
'            or, possibly, build a different program; 
'            they might choose to send in comments stating they like the program/or, not; 
'            and, how they themselves have chosen to use it/-etc.
'            You might choose to create/use a specific email address to receive users responses;
'            so that it's not confused with other mail you get.
'            Or, leave a note stating...responses should state in the email subject header: PROGRAMMING: Program name/
'            you might even state...other than for purpose of commercial sale/emails will NOT be responded to)
'  COPYRIGHT: (Sometimes, program authors choose to give away their software entirely for FREE;
'              at other times, they choose to 'limit' who can use it/and, also, for what particular purpose;
'             eg. this software is FREE for individuals to use/edit/change/study/learn from; 
'             but, may not be 'published' or used for commercial gain without having, first,
'             obtained proper permission from the author themselves.)
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'    NOTE(1): Exactly what 'source code' comments you choose to include is purely up to the programmer themselves;
'             therefore, 'source  code' comments are ALL entirely 'optional'/as opposed to being strictly 'mandatory';
'             so, the programmer could choose to leave in some comments/or, none.

'    NOTE(2): People are, in fact, free to either pay attention to/or else, totally ignore your comments if they wish;
'             therefore, the only way to keep your program 'source code' completely safe...is do NOT publish it!

'    NOTE(3): If you try running this program...; then, you will find the output is nothing more than a 'blank' screen;
'             this is because the underlying 'source code' comments are only there to be 'read'/
'             and, NOT to be viewed as being program 'output'.

'    NOTE(4): If you were to try and delete ALL of the comment lines contained herein;
'             then, you would be left with a totally 'empty' document;
'             as the code is made up entirely of 'source code' comments, alone.
