'*** PROGRAM: 'Hello, world'

'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'    'Hello, world', is traditionally the very first program that the 'beginner' programmer is taught to write;
'                    it's also frequently written by far more experienced programmers to 'test' if a particular 
'                    terminal/or, programming language, is working properly?

'     For example, if I were doing a MS DOS terminal test.................I would write it as: ECHO Hello, world!
'                  if I were doing a Python 3.x programming language test I would write it as: print("Hello, world!")
'                  if I were doing a HTML web page test...................I would write it as: <p>Hello, world!</p>
'                  -etc.

'     Using QBASIC/QB64...the format is......................................................: PRINT "Hello, world!"

'     NOTE(1): QBASIC/QB64 uses a pair of double quote marks to delimit text strings: ("").

'     NOTE(2): This process is also commonly referred to as being called, printing 'string literal' text...;
'           where each letter inside of the text string...is printed out exactly 'as is'.

'---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRINT "Hello, world!"

'...output...

'Hello, world!
