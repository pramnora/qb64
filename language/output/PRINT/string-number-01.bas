'*** The PRINT statement is used to printout either text strings/or, numbers...

'    - text strings are enclosed inside a pair of double quote marks: ("")
'    - numbers are NOT enclosed inside of quotes

'    ...in this case, I used a single print statment to print out both of these. 

'*** NOTE: When numbers are displayed in conjunction with text...;
'          then, the number is printed out with a space both before/and, also, after it.

'...output...
