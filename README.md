**1.00 - PREFACE: Explaining what this page is meant to be all about** 

Here you will find...
* QB64 example codes/programs; all of which you can freely download, and, practice studying/learning from.

Too, I've included...
* Some explanations: Comparing different BASIC versions
* Further Links
* Included are some QB64 screenshot prinouts of my programs I myself wrote.

**NOTE:** All program code which you see here/and, too, all screenshot printouts were written/created by me; including this explanation page.

**1.01 - Multiple different BASIC programming language versions** 

_Original BASIC_

>10 CLS  
>20 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>30 END

_Modern BASIC_

>CLS  
>PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>END

_VB6/(Visual BASIC 6)_

>txtMessage.Value = "Hello, world!"
...or,...
>Debug.Print("Hello, world!")

_VBScript/(Visual BASIC Script)_

>MsgBox\("Hello, world!"\)
...or,...
>document.write "Hello, world!"

_VB.Net/(Visual BASIC.Net)_

>Console.Clear()
>Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")
>Console.ReadLine()

...thus, as you can see from the above example codes; my education in learning how to use the BASIC family of programming languages does remain a constantly ongoing task.
