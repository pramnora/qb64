###1.01 FOREWORD: MOVING FROM BASIC OVER TO QBASIC    

My first 'serious' programming language was BASIC. Here is an example program...

>10 CLS  
>20 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>30 END

Later on, I switched to using 'modern day' structured BASIC's such as QBASIC...where each line of code no longer needs to be preceeded with a line number, anymore...

>CLS  
>PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>END

Next, I switched to use VBScript being written inside of HTML web pages...; it uses OOP/Object Oriented Programming code...where objects are manipulated through codes; in this case both the HTML web page 'document' object/and, also, the Windows dialog 'message box' objects.

>MsgBox("Hello, world!")
>document.write "Hello, world!"

Later still, I switched to using VB.NET...

>Console.Clear()
>Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")
>Console.ReadLine()

...thus, as you can see from the above example codes; my education in learning how to use the BASIC family of programming languages does remain a constantly ongoing task.
