**1.00 - PREFACE: Explaining this page contents...** 

Here you will find...
* **CODE REPOSITORY**: QB64 example codes/programs; all of which you can freely download, and, practice studying/learning from.

On this page itself, I've included...
* **CODE**: Comparing the many different BASIC programming language versions
* **LINKS**: Where you can both find/download a FREE copy of QB64; as well as, various online resources to QB64 programming tutorials. 
* **PICS**: Included are some actual QB64 screenshot printouts...; so you can actually get to see what the QB64 IDE/Integrated Development Environment looks like.

**NOTE:** All resources which you see here...including program code/screenshot printouts/this ReadMe document explanatory page were created by me, alone; and, without any outside help from others.

**1.01 - Multiple different BASIC programming language versions** 

_Original BASIC_

>10 CLS  
>20 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>30 END

_Modern BASIC_

>CLS  
>PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>END

_VB6/(Visual BASIC 6)_

>txtMessage.Value = "Hello, world!"
...or,...
>Debug.Print("Hello, world!")

_VBScript/(Visual BASIC Script)_

>MsgBox\("Hello, world!"\)
...or,...
>document.write "Hello, world!"

_VB.Net/(Visual BASIC.Net)_

>Console.Clear()
>Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")
>Console.ReadLine()

...thus, as you can see from the above example codes; my education in learning how to use the BASIC family of programming languages does remain a constantly ongoing task.
