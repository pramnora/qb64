1.00 **FOREWORD: MOVING FROM BASIC OVER TO QBASIC**    

My first 'serious' programming language was BASIC. Here is an example program...

100 CLS  
110 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
120 END

Later on, I switched to using 'modern day' structured BASIC's such as QBASIC...where each line of code no longer needs to be preceeded with a line number, anymore...

CLS  
PRINT "Hello, world!"  
END
