*1.01 FOREWORD: Learning BASIC*      


My first 'serious' programming language was BASIC. Here is an example program...

_Original BASIC_

>10 CLS  
>20 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>30 END

Later on, I switched to using more 'modern day' carefully structured BASIC's such as QBASIC/QB64...where each line of code no longer needed to be preceeded by line numbers, anymore...

_Modern BASIC_

>CLS  
>PRINT "Hello, world!"  
>END

Moving on, I used VBScript being written inside of HTML web pages...; it uses OOP/Object Oriented Programming code...where objects are manipulated through using code; in this case, both the HTML web page 'document' object/and, also, the Windows dialog 'message box' objects.

_VBScript_

>MsgBox\("Hello, world!"\)
...or,...
>document.write "Hello, world!"

_VB6_

>txtMessage.Value = "Hello, world!"
...or,...
>Debug.Print("Hello, world!")

Later still, I switched to using VB.NET...

_VB.Net_

>Console.Clear()
>Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")
>Console.ReadLine()

...thus, as you can see from the above example codes; my education in learning how to use the BASIC family of programming languages does remain a constantly ongoing task.
