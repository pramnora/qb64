**ASCII**/(**A**merican **S**tandard **C**ode for **I**nformation **I**nterchange)

## WHY WAS ASCII CODE INVENTED?

Going way back into computer history...;  
each computer spoke it's *own* particular language.

This situation is rather like saying,  
one person speaks only, French, alone;  
and, another person speaks only, Spanish, alone;    
but, of course, they are going to run into some very serious difficulties    
when it comes to trying to communicate, most effectively, with one another...?!  

So, it was that they had to invent a standard way    
of getting computers to be able to communicate with one together;  
hence, they went and invented **ASCII** code...which is what nearly all computers speak, now-a-days;  
and, this means if I were to try sending a message over the computer  
to be received by another computer that happens to be located on the other side of the world;  
providing that message text was being sent **ASCII** text encoded;    
and, also, the receiving computer application understands how to read/interpret **ASCII** codes;  
then, there should be no problems at all when communicating computer to computer.

## SOME IMPORTANT ASCII CHARACTER CODES WHICH ARE VERY WELL WORTHWHILE NOTING...

- ASCII character codes extend going from: 0-256.  

### Groups of ASCII character codes...

- ASCII character codes: 65-90...do represent capital letters: A-Z
- ASCII character codes: 96-122...do represent lower case letters: a-z
- ASCII character codes: 48-57...do represent numbers: 0-9 

### Individual ASCII character codes...

- ASCII character code: 12...is the CLEAR SCREEN character
- ASCII character code: 13...is the ENTER key
- ASCII character code: 33...is the exclamation mark: '!'

- etc.

## THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMMON COMPUTING CHARACTER CODE SETS

- As well as, **ASCII**, there are other highly popular encoding schemes such as: **UTF-8**;
  which is very widely use for *international* communicating using multiple different languages, as well as, English.

## CODE CHALLENGE

If you are using Windows Operating System;  
-(my sincere apologies to other Operating System users, of course, for having left them out!)-      
open up Notepad word processor;  
and, while holding down the: [ALT] key;  
and, using only your keyboard 'numbers' pad;    
type into Notepad the number: 65;  
then, see what code appears...;  
it should say, letter: 'A'.  

This means '65' is the ASCII number code used to represent keyboard letter: 'A'.
