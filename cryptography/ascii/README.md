## WHY WAS ASCII CODE INVENTED?

Going way back into computer history...;  
each computer spoke it's *own* particular language.

This situation is rather like saying,  
one person speaks only, French, alone;  
and, another person speaks only, Spanish, alone;    
but, of course, they are going to run into some very serious difficulties    
when it comes to trying to communicate, most effectively, with one another...?!  

So, it was that they had to invent a standard way    
of getting computers to be able to communicate with one together;  
hence, they went and invented **ASCII** code...which is what nearly all computers speak, now-a-days;  
and, this means if I were to try sending a message over the computer
to be received by another computer that happens to be located on the other side of the world;  
providing that message text was **ASCII** text encoded;   
and, also, the receiving computer application understands how to read/interpret **ASCII** codes;  
then, there should be no problems at all when communicating.

## SOME IMPORTANT POINTS WORTHWHILE NOTING...

- ASCII character codes extend going from: 0-256.  
- ASCII character codes: 65-90...do represent capital letters: A-Z
- ASCII character codes: 96-127...do represent lower case letterss: a-z
- ASCII character codes: 48-57...do represent numbers: 0-9 

- As well as, **ASCII**, there are other highly popular encoding schemes such as: **UTF-8**;
  which is very widely use for *international* communicating using multiple different languages, as well as, English.
