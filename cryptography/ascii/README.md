# ASCII

## The meaning of the term: ASCII

ASCII/(American Standard Code for Information Interchange)  

## WHY ASCII CODE?

Going way back into computer history; each computer spoke it's *own* particular language.

This situation is rather like saying,  
one person speaks only, French, alone;  
and, another person speaks only, Spanish, alone;  
of course, they are going to run into some serious difficulties when it comes to   
trying to communicate, most effectively, with one another...?!  

So, it was that they had to invent a standard way    
of getting computers to be able to communicate with one together;  
hence, they went and invented ASCII code...which is what nearly all computers speak;  
and, this means if I send a message to a computer than is located on the other side of the world;  
providing that message uses ASCII to communicate with...;   
and, the receiving computer application understands how to read/interpret ASCII;  
then, there should be no problems at all when communicating.
