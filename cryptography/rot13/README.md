**ROT13 chart**

ROT 13/or, ROTate 13...is a very simple alphabet code.

Basically, you...

- divide up the English 26 letter alphabet...into 2/so, 26 divided by 2 = 13;
- next, you write out each letter of the alphabet into being 2 separate rows;    
  with each row containing 13 characters...one row going on top of the other.

> A B C D E F G H I J K L M  
> N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

...and, now, you are all set to do your 'encoding/decoding' process...as the following example shows:

**Encode:** ABC = NOP

**Decode:** NOP = ABC

Of course, if you write a computer program...;   
then, the computer works much *faster* at doing both the 'encoding/decoding' process  
than would any human being who has to process it, manually, inside of their mind.

**Encode:** Thisisasecretmessage = GUVFVFNFRPERGZRFFNTR  
**Decode:** GUVFVFNFRPERGZRFFNTR = THISISASECRETMESSAGE
